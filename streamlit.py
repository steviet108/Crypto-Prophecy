    ### Summary of BTC Market Cycle Analysis
    This Analysis of the Bitcoin Cycles is meant to help answer 2 questions.
    
    1 - When will Bitcoin top out this cycle?
    
    2 - What will the price be at the top of this cycle?
    
    Analysis of the market cycles is an attempt to shed light on these two questions, and give investors an edge in this market.
    Cycles are measured from the start to the weekly low after the previous macro high and we have the Bitcoin chart from July 2010 to present day, on a logarithmic growth curve.
    The logarithmic growth curve is described as something that first exhibits explosive growth followed by an increasing taper until it reaches a plateau. I find it 
    interesting that not only is this trend identified in nature but that bitcoins growth has followed it very closely since its beginning. 
    We are interested in trying to use past data to estimate the next macro high. 
    
    Cycle #1 Topped in June of 2011 with a closing price of around 18$ and then went on to crash down to around 2.15$ marking the end of cycle #1 and the
    begining of cycle #2. Cycle #1 was around 322 days and we saw a 37,750% increase in price. 
    
    Cycle #2 Rallied from 2.15$ to 1015$ in Dec. 2013, which was a 45,500% percent increase and then went on to crash down to around 210$ in Jan of 2015
    marking the end of cycle #2. Cycle #2 was 750 days long and approximately 2.3x longer than cycle #1 or 130% Longer. 
    
    Cycle #3 Started in Dec of 2018, 1 year after the previous cycle high, and rallied to around 20k$ per Bitcoin. This was a 9,000% percent increase and from the 
    beginning of cycle #3 to the cycle high, it was 1070 days, 1.4x longer or 43% longer. 
    
    At this point we have 3 cycles and one could say we have a trend. It is also clear that the cycles are getting longer but the rate that they are getting longer
    is shortening quite quickly. Cycle #1 was 322 days from bottom to top, cycle #2 from bottom to top was 750 days or 130% longer than previous cycle, cycle #3 was 
    1070 days from bottom to top or 43% longer than previous cycle, so what will cycle #4 look like?
    
    So what can we learn from this trend that will help us use statistics and data to estimate when will this cycle #4 will end?
    
    What will the price of BTC be?

    We know that the cycles are getting longer at a slower speed and if cycle #3 was 1070 days and 43% longer than the previous cycle than based on the data we can assume 
    cycle #4 will be longer than #3 at a reduced rate of lengthing. If we cut cycle #3's rate of lengthing in half and applied 20% to cycle #4's length we get about 200 days or cycle #4
    being 200 days longer than cycle #3. It is interesting to not that currently as of mid November 2021, cycle #4 is as long as cycle #3, around 1070 days. So add 20% to where we are today
    and that puts us right around mid May, 2022. If we did the same thing but applied 10% of cycle #3 rate of lengthing we get around March 1 2022. So lets agree for the 
    purpose of this exercise that cycle #4 will top somewhere in between March 1, 2022 and May 15, 2022.

    Ok, we have a rough idea of when Bitcoin will top, now lets look at some potential prices based on those dates. We know based on the bitcoin Logarithmic curve chart
    that Bitcoin tops when its touched the upper end of the red zone. This is seen in the last 3 cycles. #1 closed a weekly candle around 18$, #2 closed around 1k$ and
    #3 closed around 20k$. So if we extrapolate our historical data to the dates of when this cycle #4 will end, we are given a weekly candle closing around 150k$ in the 
    beginning of March, and a weekly candle closing in the middle of May around 175k$.
